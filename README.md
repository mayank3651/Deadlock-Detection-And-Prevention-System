📌 Overview

The Deadlock Detection and Prevention System is a simulation-based project that demonstrates how modern operating systems handle deadlocks. It provides real-time detection and prevention mechanisms to ensure smooth process execution without resource conflicts.

🎯 Features

🔍 Deadlock Detection – Identifies circular wait conditions using graph-based algorithms.

🛡 Deadlock Prevention – Implements strategies like resource ordering, hold-and-wait avoidance, and preemptive allocation.

📊 Visualization – Interactive Gantt charts, process diagrams, and real-time status updates.

🖥 User-Friendly Dashboard – Intuitive interface with monitoring and control options.

📂 File Upload Support – Analyze custom process/resource input files to test scenarios.

🤖 Smart Assistant (Zypher) – AI-powered assistant to answer OS/deadlock-related queries.

📝 Feedback System – Collects user insights for improvement.
